<p>Lieutenant Eve Dallas must hunt down the deadly snipers terrorizing Manhattan in this fast-paced In Death thriller from J. D. Robb.<strong><br>
</strong> **<br>
The shots came quickly, silently, and with deadly accuracy. Within seconds, three people were dead at Central Park’s ice-skating rink. The victims: a talented young skater, a doctor, and a teacher. As random as random can be.  </p>
<p>Eve Dallas has seen a lot of killers during her time with the NYPSD but never one like this. A review of the security videos reveals that the victims were killed with a tactical laser rifle fired by a sniper, who could have been miles away when the trigger was pulled. And though the list of locations where the shooter could have set up seems endless, the number of people with that particular skill set is finite: police, military, professional killer.  </p>
<p>Eve’s husband, Roarke, has unlimited resources—and genius—at his disposal. And when his computer program leads Eve to the location of the sniper, she learns a shocking fact: There were two—one older, one younger. Someone is being trained by an expert in the science of killing, and they have an agenda. Central Park was just a warm-up. And as another sniper attack shakes the city to its core, Eve realizes that though we’re all shaped by the people around us, there are those who are just born evil...</p>

Just as Dennis Mira is about to confront his cousin Edward about selling the West Village brownstone that belonged to their grandfather, he gets a shock: Edward is in front of him, bruised and bloody...and then everything goes black. <br>

When Dennis comes to, Edward is gone. Luckily Dennis’s wife is a top profiler for the NYPSD—and a close colleague of Lieutenant Eve Dallas. Now Eve is determined to uncover the secrets of Edward Mira and learn what enemies he may have made in his long career as a lawyer, judge, and senator. A badge and a billionaire husband can get you access to places others can’t go, and Eve intends to shine some light on the dirty deals and dark motives behind the disappearance of a powerful man, the family discord over a multimillion-dollar piece of real estate...and a new case that no one saw coming.  </p>

<p>**</p><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3>
<p>Bestseller Robb's subpar 42nd novel set in a near-future New York (after 2015's Devoted in Death) finds Eve's friend Dennis Mira, husband of her psychiatrist colleague, Charlotte Mira, requesting her help after his cousin, former U.S. senator Edward Mira, goes missing, presumably kidnapped. It doesn't take long for Edward's corpse to show up or for another similarly tortured and abused victim to be discovered. Edward was a serial adulterer, and as Eve tracks down his paramours, she discovers disturbing connections. Links between Edward and the second victim also appear, and Eve, assisted as always by her lover, Roarke, and supporting staff, engages in a race to identify the killers and protect other likely victims. The crimes are ugly and the victims more so, and Eve has to fight through her own brutal past in this less than sparkling entry in Robb's popular series. Agent: Amy Berkower, Writers House.

<p><strong>Lieutenant Eve Dallas uncovers a conspiracy when she investigates the murders of some of New York City's troubled youth in this thriller in the #1 </strong><span style=""font-weight: 600; font-style: italic"">New York Times</span><strong> bestselling In Death series.</strong> </p>
<p>Leading the demolition of a long-empty New York building that once housed a makeshift shelter for troubled teenagers, Lieutenant Eve Dallas’s husband uncovers two skeletons wrapped in plastic. And by the time Eve’s done with the crime scene, there are twelve murders to be solved. </p>
<p>The victims are all young girls. A tattooed tough girl who dealt in illegal drugs. The runaway daughter of a pair of well-to-do doctors. They all had their stories. And they all lost their chance for a better life. </p>
<p>Then Eve discovers a connection between the victims and someone she knows. And she grows even more determined to reveal the secrets of the place that was called The Sanctuary—and the evil concealed in one human heart. </p>
<p>**</p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: large"">From Booklist</strong> </p>
<p>The rundown building has good bones. That is exactly why Roarke bought it. The problem is the building has some real bones in it as well. While breaking through an interior wall to kick off the renovation, Roarke discovers bones wrapped in plastic. A quick call to his wife, Lieutenant Eve Dallas of the New York Police and Security Department, brings Eve and her team to the site. Eventually, 12 bodies are found in the building. With the help of the department’s new forensic anthropologist, Eve is able to pinpoint the time of the murders to 15 years earlier when the building served as the Sanctuary, a shelter for troubled and/or homeless teens. When Eve begins tracing the lives of each of the young girls who died there, she not only finds herself tracking a killer, but she also discovers a startling connection between the crimes and someone in her own life. The latest nail-biting installment in Robb’s long-running Eve Dallas series features the same skillfully drawn ­characters and masterful way with suspense that have ensnared readers since Naked in Death (1995). --John Charles </p>

<hr>
<p>****Homicide cop Eve Dallas and her billionaire husband, Roarke, are building a brand-new school and youth shelter. They know that the hard life can lead kids toward dangerous crossroads―and with this new project, they hope to nudge a few more of them onto the right path. For expert help, they hire child psychologist Dr. Rochelle Pickering―whose own brother pulled himself out of a spiral of addiction and crime with Rochelle’s support. </p>
<p>Lyle is living with Rochelle while he gets his life together, and he’s thrilled to hear about his sister’s new job offer. But within hours, triumph is followed by tragedy. Returning from a celebratory dinner with her boyfriend, she finds Lyle dead with a syringe in his lap, and Eve’s investigation confirms that this wasn’t just another OD. After all his work to get clean, Lyle’s been pumped full of poison―and a neighbor with a peephole reports seeing a scruffy, pink-haired girl fleeing the scene.</p>
<p>Now Eve and Roarke must venture into the gang territory where Lyle used to run, and the ugly underground world of tattoo parlors and strip joints where everyone has taken a wrong turn somewhere. They both believe in giving people a second chance. Maybe even a third or fourth. But as far as they’re concerned, whoever gave the order on Lyle Pickering’s murder has run out of chances…</p>

Robb, better known as the bestselling author Nora Roberts.</p><p>In the late 21st century, on the streets of New York City, a street sleeper is found murdered, his diseased heart removed with surgical precision. His death would typically drop to the bottom of a list of senseless and inexplicable killings, but Lieutenant Dallas, who ""would stand for the dead and the living,"" is not about to let that happen. When her research uncovers similar crimes in several cities that were dropped under mysterious circumstances, Dallas knows she's facing a killer cruel enough to prey on the weakest in society and powerful enough to conspire an extensive coverup.</p><p>To complicate matters further, Dallas faces an equally troubling threat to her career when she's linked to the death of a fellow cop. Now she must fight to restore her good name as well as track down the killer.</p><p>In <em>Conspiracy in Death</em>, Roberts creates a futuristic world of evil that Eve Dallas negotiates through tough talk and brute force. While Robb crafts the crimes with great care, she assumes a familiarity with the characters that new readers will lack. But fans of the In Death series and newcomers alike will enjoy the thrill of the chase as Eve Dallas sets out to get her man. <em>--Nancy R.E. O'Brien</em></p><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p>""For some, death wasn't the enemy. Life was a much less merciful opponent."" So opens the eighth and latest installment (following Holiday in Death) in Robb's (a.k.a. Nora Roberts's) futuristic crime drama series. Moody, angst-ridden Lieutenant Eve Dallas investigates a series of ""sidewalk sleeper"" murders. The medically skilled killer is harvesting defective human organs from New York City's homeless population. When Eve gets too close to solving the crime, she becomes the prime suspect in the death of a fellow cop and loses her badge, which nearly destroys her emotionally. But this feisty heroine isn't down for long; she rallies and returns to form as the maverick cop readers know and love. Followers of the Death series will see a slight softening in Eve's character as she puzzles over a pregnant womanAa possible nod toward the end of this series (Loyalty in Death will follow this title). Until then, Robb has once again delivered an engrossing, first-rate read. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc. </p></div>

<span class=""synopsis"">At a time when human nature remains as predictable as death, a killer plays God - and puts innocent lives in the palm of his hand....<br> <br> It was always a shock, not the hard one Bowers had hoped for. Eve had seen too much for that. But what one human could do to another was never routine for her. With the precision of a surgeon, a serial killer preys on the most vulnerable of souls of the world's city streets. The first victim: a homeless person, found dead in New York City. No bruises, no signs of a struggle. Just a laser-perfect, fist-sized hole where his heart had once been. Detective Eve Dallas is assigned to investigate. But as she is lured in to a cat-and-mouse game with the killer, Dallas also becomes the focus of an internal investigation. In her mind, Eve feels she has done nothing except irritate some fellow cops with connections in high places. But her struggle to bring a murderer to justice is about to be hindered by the fight to save her career. Now her hands are tied... between a struggle for justice - and a fight for her career....</span>",,.,,,,,,,,12.93,2024:12:18 01:49:48-05:00,2024:12:18 01:36:49-05:00,,,,2024:12:18 00:30:50-05:00,JD_ROBB_Conspiracy_in_Death_-_JD_Robb.epub,,-rw-rw-rw-,555 kB,,EPUB,epub,,,,,,../titlepage.xhtml,Cover,cover,r/j-d-robb/conspiracy-in-death,uuid_id,uuid,,,,,en,,,,,,,,Text/CONSPIRACYINDEATH_full-body_10.html,a10,application/xhtml+xml,,,Conspiracy in Death,,calibre:title_sort,,,,,application/epub+zip,2013:09:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,Thorndike Pr,,Copyrights as per source stories,,,titlepage,,,ncx,"Police, Dallas, Police - New York (State) - New York, Fiction, Mystery Fiction, Women Sleuths, Mystery & Detective - Women Sleuths, Eve (Fictitious character), New York (N.Y.), Policewomen, Dallas; Eve (Fictitious Character), Large Type Books, Mystery, Police Procedural, Detective, Mystery & Detective, American Mystery & Suspense Fiction, Fiction - Mystery, New York, Suspense, Mystery & Detective - Police Procedural, New York (State)",,,,,,,,Conspiracy in Death,,,,,,,,,,,,Exists

D.",,aut,2007:11:05 16:00:00+00:00,"<div><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p>At 27 books and counting, Nora Roberts is more prolific under her Robb pseudonym than most authors manage in a single career. Yet the latest in her not-so-near-future detective series featuring New York Police Det. Eve Dallas offers a satisfyingly novel mélange of suspense, sex, forensics and heroics. It's 2060, and the serial killer nicknamed The Groom is back in town after an absence of nine years, resuming his horrific run of kidnapping, torturing and killing young women. Dallas, who served as a detective in the frustrating first investigation, assumes lead role in this one. This time, not only do the killer's chosen victims have ties to Dallas's husband, Roarke, but Dallas herself may be the killer's ultimate target. Swiftly paced, the story cuts frequently from the investigation to the killer's progress with his victims. Dallas works to outplan, outfight and outsmart the killer; to keep her handsome, rich husband happy; and to be ready for the next round after a good night's sleep. Robb's latest is bound to please Dallas fans. <em>(Nov.)</em> <br>Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Raymond Chandler meets Blade Runner meets Silence of the Lambs. The techno-toys may change, but evil never does.”<br>—Jonathan Kellerman<br></p><p>“J.D. Robb (you-know-who!) has written a taut, nerve-jangling, thriller that draws the reader in from the start and rolls you over the dancing ball bearings of a futuristic police procedural that moves seamlessly and unrelentingly forward. The quality of the prose and the sharpness of the dialogue will delight and even surprise the reader. I know it did me. AS IF she needed it: but now she has yet another loyal fan.” <br>—Ridley Pearson<br></p></div>

<span id=""freeText16230832450576044114"" style="""">Eve has seen this crime scene before: the artfully arranged body of a young brunette, arms spread, palms up, body marked by the signs of prolonged and painful torture. Carved into her torso is the time it took her to die—in hours, minutes, and seconds. And on the third finger of her left hand has been placed a silver ring. Eve is catapulted back to a case nine years earlier, when a man whom the media tagged —The Groom— put the city on edge with a killing spree that took the lives of four women in fifteen days. Eve and her partner Feeney, her friend and mentor, couldn't stop him before he disappeared, only to resurface in other parts of the world to kill and kill again. But now The Groom seems to have come back to where he started. <br><br>When it turns out that The Groom's most recent victim was employed by Eve's billionaire husband, Roarke, she brings him into the case. A move that proves fitting when it becomes chillingly clear that the killer has made it personal. The corpse was washed in products from a store Roarke owns and laid out on a sheet his company manufactures. With the Groom's monstrous return, Eve is determined to finish him once and for all. Familiar with his methods, she knows that he has already grabbed his next victim. But his sights are set on the biggest challenge of his illustrious career—an abduction that will test his skills and that promises to give him satisfaction as he's never known. Time is running out on another woman's life—and for Eve.<a class=""actionLinkLite"" href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1566705.Creation_in_Death#""></a></span>",,.,,,,,,,,12.93,2024:12:18 01:49:48-05:00,2024:12:18 01:36:49-05:00,,,,2024:12:18 00:31:10-05:00,JD_ROBB_Creation_in_Death_-_JD_Robb.epub,,-rw-rw-rw-,500 kB,,EPUB,epub,,,,,,Text/creationindeath_contents.html,Table of Contents,toc,{EBBD86BD-26CE-4C00-8D62-0FF18E0A7390},uuid_id,uuid,,,,,en,,,,,,,,Text/GlobalBackad.html,GlobalBackad.html,application/xhtml+xml,,,Creation in Death,,calibre:title_sort,,,,,application/epub+zip,2013:09:25,,,,,,,,,,,,,Penguin,,Copyright © 2007 by Nora Roberts,,,titlepage,,,ncx,"Mystery, Police Procedural, Detective and Mystery Stories, Police, Serial Murders, New York (N.Y), Mystery & Detective, New York (N.Y.), Police - New York (State) - New York, Policewomen, New York, Mystery Fiction, Dallas; Eve (Fictitious Character), General, Large Type Books, New York (State), Fiction, Women Sleuths",,,,,,,,Creation in Death,,,,,,,,,,,,Exists

Only Robb's and Ryan's stories adhere to the volume's ""bump in the night"" theme, and they are the weakest by far. The former, which centers on a murder in a haunted house, substitutes tough cop talk between series detective Eve Dallas and her assistant for verve and suspense; the latter spins a by-the-numbers romance between two workaholics who find love and inner peace while relaxing near a haunted lake. The remaining stories feature a sunnier atmosphere and more well-developed protagonists. Blayney tells a sweet if conventional 19th-century romance in which a young girl's magic coin helps a widow and a down-on-his-luck officer find happiness. But it's the inventive contribution from relative unknown McComas, about a woman who changes her life for the better with the help of her handsome imaginary friend, that steals the show. McComas focuses on the most important relationship of all—the relationship one has with oneself—and spins an introspective and irresistible story that, for some readers, may make this collection worthwhile. <em>(Apr.)</em> <br>Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Lieutenant Eve Dallas is called there to investigate the apparent murder of Radcliff Hopkins, its new owner and the grandson of the man who made Number Twelve a cultural icon. Several bullets from a banned gun end his dream of returning the building to its former glory.<br> <br> With everyone around her talking about the supernatural, pragmatic Eve won't let rumors of ghosts distract her from hard evidence. The case becomes even more bizarre when it appears to be linked to the suspicious disappearance of a rock star eighty-five years ago.

Robb's futuristic romance thrillers, NYPD Lieutenant Eve Dallas is on the trail of a serial killer terrorizing the city during the holidays. The only link between the victims--all are patrons of an exclusive dating service, Personally Yours. Working with her aide Officer Peabody, Peabody's nemesis Ian McNab, and her own intriguing husband, Roarke, Eve uncovers secrets that link the victims: secrets that involve both the owners and the clients of Personally Yours and which might be worth killing for. Whether she's writing as Nora Roberts or as J.D. Robb, Roberts weaves a taut and powerful story with lush sensuality and masterful characterization. This murder mystery combines elements of romance, science fiction, and police procedural genres in an entertaining mix that will keep readers turning the pages. <em>--Lisa Wanttaja</em></p><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p>The year is 2058. Guns are banned and medical science has learned how to prolong life to well beyond the century mark. And man has yet to stop killing man. At Cop Central, it's Lieutenant Eve Dallas's job to stand up for the dead. So begins the seventh riveting installment in Robb's (aka Nora Roberts) futuristic romantic suspense series (following Vengeance in Death). With Christmas only weeks away, Eve is stressing out trying to find the right gift for her new husband, Rourke, who ""not only had everything, but owned most of the plants and factories that made it."" More to her concern is the latest serial killer who is using ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" as a theme for his heinous rape and murder spree. The case touches Eve on a personal level, and while flash-backs from her abusive childhood are flinchingly repetitious, it defines Eve's gritty, hard-boiled character and validates her obsessive determination to bring down the killer any way she can. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc. </p></div>

D.",,aut,1997:01:01 16:00:00+00:00,"<div><div><h3>Amazon.com Review</h3><p>Police Lieutenant Eve Dallas encounters one of her most difficult cases in this latest offering from J. D. Robb, alter ego of bestselling author Nora Roberts. With the very first victim, Eve realizes that the killer stalking the streets of New York City isn't a run-of-the-mill serial murderer. The copycat executions are imitating the methods and victim choices of an ominous list of notorious serial killers, beginning with Jack the Ripper. And when the killer leaves a distinctive note at the crime scene, it's clear that he's targeting Eve personally--a fact that worries Roarke, Eve's shrewd husband. </p><p>Assisted by her aide, Peabody, Eve compiles a list of suspects that includes several high-profile possibilities. Their very prominence, however, complicates the investigation, for they have the power and influence to make the search difficult. All of the suspects are reluctant to cooperate but one of them is playing with Eve like a cat with a mouse by tempting her with crime scene notes and challenging her to find him. Can Eve stop him before he slaughters again? Or will his next victim be Eve herself?</p><p>Author Robb, a.k.a. Roberts, doesn't miss a beat in this police procedural thriller. The futuristic setting is rich with imaginative details; the cast of supporting characters offers an intriguing variety, while Eve and Roarke's relationship is layered with emotional intimacy and spiced with sex. Whether you're a faithful follower or new to the series, you won't be disappointed in the edge-of-the-seat suspense in <em>Imitation In Death</em>. Don't miss this one. <em>--Lois Faye Dyer</em></p><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p>The latest entry in Robb's series of feisty futuristic mysteries (after Portrait in Death) delivers. This time, Lt. Eve Dallas shows up to investigate the grisly killing of a New York City prostitute only to find a note from the killer on the body. Signed ""Jack,"" the note taunts Eve by name and affirms what she has already guessed-that the murder was specifically planned to imitate Jack the Ripper. Purchasers of the costly foreign stationery that the killer used-a crime writer, a top diplomat and a famous musician-become Eve's suspects. As she investigates them, a second killing occurs, this time in the manner of the Boston Strangler. Aided by her faithful second-in-command, Peabody (who's nervously awaiting her detective's exam), and supported by her handsome husband Roarke, Eve scours both the country and the past for clues. The solution to the puzzle is far less intriguing than the copycat-killer premise, and readers might wonder why detection in the year 2059 is so low-tech-where, for example, are DNA and forensic testing? As always, however, Robb's delightfully snappy dialogue, playful sexuality and whirlwind pacing will keep readers captivated. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc. </p></div>

In this latest installment of the In Death series, author J.D. Robb (a.k.a. Nora Roberts) casts our heroine against an enigmatic group of terrorists named Cassandra. With no clear motivation or demands, Cassandra feeds on the thrill of senseless killing and the calculated destruction of Eve's world.</p><p>Relying on her own brawn and brains, as well as that of her aid Peabody and her husband Roarke, Eve begins to unravel a mystery that began decades before. When the killer's threats land close to home, Eve knows she has no choice but to gamble her own life for the chance to save her city as well as her loved ones.</p><p>J.D. Robb's combinations of mystery, suspense, and romance keep the fans of this series clamoring for more, and <em>Loyalty in Death</em> has equal amounts of each. While the passion between Eve and Roarke is as good as ever, the introduction of a new romantic element certainly turns up the heat and is a welcome twist. Though the evil-terrorist-in-NYC theme has been done before (most recently in <em>The Siege</em>), these beloved characters put up a good fight, and keep us glued to the pages. <em>--Nancy R.E.

It's Trudy Lombard, the cruel foster mom who took nine-year-old Eve in after Eve killed her abusive father. Trudy made Eve take cold baths and locked her in closets, among other torments, and now Trudy wants Eve to pay $2 million to keep her past a secret. Readers of the series will know how Roarke, Eve's rich, deadly husband, handles the situation; he tosses Trudy out on her ear. When Trudy is found murdered the next day, it's up to Eve to catch the killer and prove that neither she nor Roarke was behind the bludgeoning. All the action takes place over Christmas, and Eve, being Eve, complains about the foolishness of the holiday, but Roarke et al. continue to slowly teach Eve the virtues of love, family and friendship.

When a senator's daughter is killed, the secret life of prostitution she'd been leading is revealed. The high-profile case takes Lieutenant Eve Dallas into the rarefied circles of Washing-ton politics and society.

In Roberts's latest In Death novel (after Purity in Death), she's charged with finding a killer who murders young people full of innocence and promise, photographs them after death, then taunts both a top reporter and Dallas herself with notes about his handiwork. Just as her investigation of Manhattan's clubs and colleges nears its peak, Eve's husband, the wealthy entrepreneur Roarke, discovers that his mother is not the cold abandoner he remembers, but a tender young Irishwoman whom his father brutally murdered. While he struggles to understand his heritage, the couple must navigate stormy marital waters. Though the mystery's denouement doesn't live up to its promise, the book ably delivers on other fronts. Intensely female yet unfeminine in any traditional sense, Dallas has a complex edge that transcends genre stereotypes and gives the book's romantic interludes a real charge. As always in Roberts's work, appealing secondary characters add genuine warmth and humor. And while this futuristic vision of New York may not be totally accurate (it's unlikely, for example, that Dallas's oft-used ""bite me"" will still be in vogue 50 years from now), it's perfectly calibrated to intrigue.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc. </p><h3>Review</h3><p>“<strong>Portrait In Death</strong> will take you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions.

D.",,aut,2001:12:31 16:00:00+00:00,"<div><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Seasoned author Nora Roberts, writing as Robb, delivers another exhilarating entry in her popular futuristic cop series featuring Eve Dallas (Seduction in Death, etc.). Dallas, a New York police lieutenant, is a hard-bitten warrior cop who buries the pain and anger of her early childhood by excelling on the job. In her latest adventure, all the usual suspects are back: Eve's charismatic husband, Roarke; her plucky assistant, Peabody; and hipster techno-geek McNab. For this round, their objective is to take down a woman Eve arrested 10 years ago, a poisoner named Julianna Dunne. Julianna's out on parole, and now rich old men are dying sudden deaths. What's more, the ex-con wants to exact a little revenge on her one-time adversary. Eve's search for Dunne takes her all over the country, and eventually to Dallas, Tex., the city that gave her both her name and a legacy of violent nightmares. This is a satisfying, well-paced novel that offers readers a little of everything sex, death, family drama and well-orchestrated chase scenes. Although Robb's plot is tight and suspenseful, the real pleasure here comes from watching Eve struggle to maintain her distance from others, even as she finds herself tied ever more closely to her friends and family by the bonds of love. (Mar. 5)Forecast: It's a given that Roberts's books will grace the bestseller charts, but a stylish cover image depicting a ghostly, Manhattan subway entrance may attract new readers.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc. </p><h3>From Library Journal</h3><p>The most recent chapter of Robb's popular series features Lt. Eve Dallas facing a recently released murderer back to get even. Early in her career, Eve testified against Julianna Dunn, and, during her incarceration, Julianna has been planning how to confuse, humiliate, and ultimately destroy her. This violent reunion begins with the poisoning of middle-aged, wealthy men in seemingly innocuous circumstances on Eve's New York City beat and soon looks like it will culminate with the killing of her husband, Roark. Disconcerting houseguests, a tense visit into Eve's childhood in the city of Dallas, and a comic scene searching for clues in the New York underworld add to the plot and give reader Susan Ericksen the opportunity to charm the listener thoroughly. Her reading is full of color: her accent, pitch, and pacing all add to the listening experience and make this one difficult tape to pause.

D.",,aut,2007:12:31 16:00:00+00:00,"<div><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Holy communion spells death for Fr. Miguel Flores, a popular Catholic priest in New York City's Spanish Harlem, after he swallows wine laced with cyanide during a funeral in bestseller Robb's unusually introspective 27th crime thriller to feature Lt. Eve Dallas (after <em>Strangers in Death</em>). The ensuing homicide investigation suggests that Flores could actually be Lino Martinez, a former member of a disbanded gang, the Soldados, suspected of two bombings before he disappeared. The death by cyanide of another religious figure, Jimmy Jay Jenkins, founder of the Church of Eternal Light, complicates matters. Are the two murders connected? Sussing out the answer to that question involves some serious digging. Dallas's husband, Roarke, and fun sidekick, Det. Delia Peabody, lend support. Robb offers a multilayered solution to several crimes that serves as yet another reminder that wolves sometimes hide in sheep's (or priest's) clothing, but justice, like faith, has no expiration date. <em>(Nov.)</em> <br>Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. </p><h3>From Booklist</h3><p>The Eve Dallas series of near-future mysteries rolls comfortably along in this latest installment, the twenty-ninth. The series began in 1995 so the author can fairly be accused of cranking them out (she’s also published a book or two under her real name, Nora Roberts). Despite being a lesser product of the Roberts machine, the Dallas novels have a certain charm, in a mass-produced kind of way. The near-future setting (the mid-twenty-first century) is nicely realized without being too excessively detailed; the protagonist, homicide detective Dallas, is a likable and strong character, well able to support a multivolume series; and the cases—including this one, about a murder in an ancient church, the aftermath of which reveals that the victim might not have been the gentle Catholic priest his parishioners thought he was—are imaginative and suspenseful. The dialogue is a little clumsy, and the narrative passages sometimes seem a bit contrived, but there’s a reason so many Dallas novels have appeared in so short a time: they sell. So will this one. --David Pitt </p></div>

D.",,aut,2004:01:01 16:00:00+00:00,"<div><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p>In the 20th fine volume of Roberts's futuristic mystery franchise, police lieutenant Eve Dallas is called in when lawyer Grant Swisher and his family are massacred with eerie skillfulness on the Upper West Side. The only survivor is 10-year-old Nixie, who evades—and witnesses—the killers as she creeps down to the kitchen for a midnight snack. Despite the painful memories of her own childhood that Nixie's presence calls up, Eve decides to hide the girl in the high-tech mansion she shares with her husband, billionaire businessman Roarke. With help from Roarke; her faithful sidekick, Peabody; and others, Eve discovers the existence of a shadowy former military operative with a grudge against Swisher—the lawyer helped the operative's battered wife divorce him right before she disappeared. The relatively early disclosure of the villain's identity and the dearth of other viable suspects dulls the suspense in the first half of the book, but tension escalates toward an absorbing denouement as a trap Eve sets for her target ends up with Nixie as its unintentional bait. Throughout, the series' colorful supporting cast and Eve's prickly personality—smartly showcased in her power struggles with everything from space-age vending machines to her own past—remain as vividly appealing as ever. <br>Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. </p><h3>Review</h3><p>This is sheer entertainment, a souped-up version of Agatha Christie for the new millennium </p></div>

<span class=""synopsis"">No affairs. No criminal connections. No DNA. No clues. Eve Dallas may be the best cop in the city--not to mention having the lavish resources of her husband, Roarke, at her disposal--but the Swisher case has her baffled. On the surface Keelie and Grant Swisher seem unlikely targets for an assassin; an average couple living in a nice neighbourhood and working hard to raise their two kids. But when Eve Dallas is called to a multiple homicide at the Swisher family home, she discovers a blood-bath. There are five dead - including two children - in what seems to be a professional hit. The killers breached an elaborate state-of-the-art security system, and the killers used night-vision equipment to find their way through the cozy, middle-class house. With brutal, military precision, they slashed the throat of each victim while they slept in their beds; and were in and out of the house in less than ten minutes. Clearly, Eve is dealing with pros. In fact they made only one mistake... they left a survivor. They overlooked the nine-year-old girl cowering in the darkened kitchen. Nixie Swisher's sudden urge for a midnight snack may just have saved her life. While her parents, brother and best-friend lay in their beds, oblivious to the threat, Nixie was downstairs in the kitchen getting a soda... and she saw far too much.<br> <br> Kids are not Dallas's strong suit. But Now Nixie Swisher is an orphan-and the sole eyewitness to a seemingly inexplicable crime, and Dallas needs to solve this case. Eve knows that her priority is to keep her safe. Offering her a temporary refuge is easy, but dealing with the emotional needs of a nine-year-old girl who has lost everything isn't. Not only for the cause of justice. With her partner, Peabody, back on the job-and her husband, Roarke, providing the kind of help that only he can give-Lieutenant Eve Dallas is running after shadows, and dead-set on finding out who's behind them. But also to put to rest some of her own darkest memories--and deepest fears. But she's chasing professionals who don't like leaving loose ends. And leaving Nixie Swisher alive is one loose end too many....</span>",,.,,,,,,,,12.93,2024:12:18 01:49:50-05:00,2024:12:18 01:36:49-05:00,,,,2024:12:18 00:43:17-05:00,JD_ROBB_Survivor_in_Death_-_JD_Robb.epub,,-rw-rw-rw-,334 kB,,EPUB,epub,,,,,,../titlepage.xhtml,Cover,cover,r/j-d-robb/survivor-in-death,uuid_id,uuid,,,,,en,,,,,,,,Images/logo.jpg,a30,image/jpeg,,,Survivor in Death,,calibre:title_sort,,,,,application/epub+zip,2013:09:24,,,,,,,,,,,,,Berkley,,Copyrights as per source stories,,,titlepage,,,ncx,,,,,,,,,Survivor in Death,,,,,,,,,,,,Exists

Maybe people wouldn't be as inclined to kill each other. But she doubted it.' Eve Dallas' latest homicide case is a particularly vicious case. A young mother, Elisa Maplewood, is found raped and strangled in the park, her body naked but for what appears to be a red ribbon tied around her neck. As Eve starts investigating Elisa's friends and relations, an offer of help comes from an unlikely source. The only reason Eve agrees to meet with psychic Celina Sanchez is that she is a friend of a friend. But Celina claims to have experienced visions of the killer and can recite precise details of the case - details that the police have kept to themselves. She is also no glory-hunter - she doesn't want her name released to the media. Haunted by the visions of death that she sees, all she wants to do is help Eve catch the criminal so that she is left in peace. Though Eve remains sceptical of Celina's abilities, she serves the greater good, and she will use all the resources she can to track down the killer before he strikes again...",,.,,,,,,,,12.93,2024:12:18 01:36:50-05:00,2024:12:18 01:36:50-05:00,,,,2024:12:18 00:16:08-05:00,JD_ROBB_Visions_in_Death_Dutch_Edition_-_Roberts_Nora.epub,,-rw-rw-rw-,778 kB,,EPUB,epub,,,,,,Visions_in_Death_split_023.html#filepos782176,Table of Contents,toc,30e87e10-30bf-430d-810e-3a7313b9100c,uuid_id,ISBN,,,,,nl,,,,,,,,Visions_in_Death_split_000.html,id124,application/xhtml+xml,,,2011:02:01 16:43:14.414000+00:00,,calibre:timestamp,,,,,application/epub+zip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Piatkus,,,,,titlepage,,,ncx,"General, Fiction, Mystery, Crime & mystery, Mystery & Detective, Suspense, Police, Crime & Thriller, Policewomen, Detective and mystery stories, Police Procedural, Psychics, Eve (Fictitious character), Dallas",,,,,,,,Visions in Death,,,,,,,,,,,,Exists

On opening night, when the villainous character Leonard Vole gets his just deserts, someone substitutes a kitchen knife for the prop knife, and the actor, Richard Draco, is stabbed through the heart. Trouble is, in time-tested British mystery fashion, everyone in the cast had good reason to despise Richard, a misogynist who seduced and discarded beautiful young women, including one whom he knew to be his daughter. It's up to Eve to solve the case, an emotionally difficult task as she is no stranger to incest herself: she was beaten and raped by her father before she managed to escape him. As Eve fights to keep her head above water, she tries to bond at a deeper level with Roarke, so that her future will heal the pain of her past. Robb (aka Nora Roberts) serves up a welcome mix of edgy, sexy lovers,newfangled gadgets, classic whodunit and noir.
